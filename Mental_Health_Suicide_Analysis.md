# Mental Health and Suicide Trends Analysis (2002–2022)

### Area-Level (Provincial) & Individual-Level Analysis

## 1. Tentative Analysis Questions

### 1. Descriptive Analysis

-   How have **mental health indicators** changed over time (**2002, 2012, 2022**) across different demographics (age, province, sex) at both **individual and provincial levels**?
-   What are the **suicide rate trends in Canada** over the 20-year period?
    -   How do suicide rates vary across different **demographic groups (age, sex, ethnicity, income level)?**\
    -   How do suicide rates vary at the **province level**? Are certain provinces disproportionately affected?
-   Are there **regional disparities** in mental health conditions and suicide rates?
    -   Which **provinces have the highest vs. lowest rates** of mental health disorders and suicide?\
-   How have **economic indicators (CPI, inflation, unemployment)** varied across provinces over time?
    -   Does economic distress correlate with worsening mental health trends?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Inferential Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

-   Is there a **statistically significant relationship** between mental health disorders and suicide rates at both **the individual level (survey data)** and **the area level (province-wide stats)**?
-   Do certain **demographic groups (age, sex, income level, ethnicity)** have significantly higher suicide rates?
-   How does **regional unemployment, inflation, and cost of living** impact suicide rates and mental health prevalence?
-   **Has inflation (CPI, housing costs, economic recessions)** contributed to an increase in mental health disorders or suicides?
-   Is there a **disparity in mental health treatment access** between different **regions (urban vs. rural areas, wealthy vs. lower-income provinces)?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Predictive Analysis

-   **Can we predict high-risk groups** for suicide using a combination of **mental health indicators, economic conditions (CPI, inflation, unemployment), and demographic data**?
-   **Which mental health disorders** have the strongest association with suicide rates?
    -   Are **certain mental illnesses (e.g., depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance abuse) more predictive** of suicide risk than others?
-   **Which machine learning model (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) performs best** in predicting suicide risk?
-   How well do **mental health disorders correlate with suicide trends** across **provinces, demographic groups, and economic conditions**?
-   Which factors (**mental health conditions, economic distress, demographics**) contribute most to **suicide risk at both an individual and provincial level**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Trend & Sentiment Analysis (Reddit Data Integration)

-   How do **public discussions on mental health (from Reddit sentiment analysis) align with actual suicide rates and disorder prevalence?**
-   Can we detect **emerging mental health crises** using sentiment trends in **Reddit discussions**?
-   Are **certain topics (financial stress, job loss, relationships, housing costs, healthcare accessibility) recurring themes** in mental health discussions?
-   **Comparing regional sentiment:**
    -   Do people from **high-suicide-rate provinces discuss different mental health concerns** compared to lower-risk provinces?\
    -   Are certain **regions more vocal** about mental health issues online?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Methods

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

-   **Handling missing data** using imputation techniques based on area-level and individual-level characteristics.
-   **Standardization & Normalization** of numerical data (CPI, inflation, suicide rates).
-   **Aggregating individual-level data** for province-wide and national-level analysis.
-   **Merging external datasets** (economic indicators, healthcare access data, social determinants of health).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Modeling

#### 1. Logistic Regression

-   Baseline model for **binary classification** (e.g., high vs. low suicide risk at both **individual and province levels**).

#### 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-   Detect complex patterns in **suicide risk classification** using mental health, economic, and demographic factors.

#### 3. Random Forest

-   Identify **feature importance** and **non-linear relationships** between predictors and suicide risk.

#### 4. Time-Series Forecasting

-   Predict future **mental health disorder rates and suicide rates** using economic and social indicators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Sentiment Analysis on Reddit Data

-   **Scrape/Collect Reddit posts related to mental health** using API or datasets.
-   Perform **Sentiment Analysis (VADER, TextBlob, or BERT-based models)** to measure online discussions.
-   Compare **sentiment trends with actual suicide rates** (correlation analysis, time-series comparisons).
-   **Topic Modeling (LDA)** to uncover emerging themes in mental health discussions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Model Interpretation & Insights

-   **Feature Importance Analysis**: Using Random Forest to determine which factors (mental health indicators, economy, demographics) contribute most to suicide risk.
-   **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) Analysis**: Explain model predictions and assess which factors drive suicide risk at individual vs. provincial levels.
-   **Trend Visualization**:
    -   Heatmaps & Geographic Maps (regional suicide & mental health prevalence)\
    -   Time-Series Analysis (trends over 20 years)\
    -   Word Clouds (for mental health themes from Reddit)
